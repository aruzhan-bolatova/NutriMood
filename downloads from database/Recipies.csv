Set aside.. Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.. Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance.. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons.. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.. Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways.. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.. Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.. Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.. Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.. In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.. Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.. Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.. With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.. Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.. Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage.. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread.

An efficient oven is important for this dish. If the oven is too cold, the fish will not get cooked. If the oven tends to get too hot, the fish will be roasted and overcooked. If you are uncertain, then think about whether your cookies/cakes are usually overdone or underdone when you follow a recipe exactly. If they are always overdone, then you can turn down the temperature to 110C.Get the freshest salmon fillets you can get your hands on. The thick ones are the nicest for this dish.. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the salmon fillets and rub it all over the fish.Season generously with salt and pepper. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I usually use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper for each time that I need salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the fish.Slice two lemons into thick slices, discarding the ends.. Lay the slices of lemons on a baking tray lined with baking paper.. Place the salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. If you have left the skin on for the fillets, then make sure its skin side down.. Place the salmon fillets in the oven and cook for 25 mins. If the salmon fillets are very thick, cook a little longer for another 3 to 5 mins.While the fish is cooking, prepare the vegetable medley and sauce.Peel a large carrot and diagonally slice into thin slices.Wash and pluck the leaves of a bunch of spinach. I used about 150g of baby spinach.. Heat a deep saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Keep the heat at medium heat.When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter.When the butter has melted, add the carrots and stir fry for a minute to cook and soften the carrots. I like them slightly crunchy so I dont cook them for too long here. Keep the heat at medium.. Remove the cooked carrot slices and set aside in a warm place.In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry for 20 seconds.. Add the spinach leaves. Stir fry at medium heat.. Add salt and pepper to taste. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I used Masterfoods Garlic Pepper seasonings instead again.Stir fry the spinach till its soft and wilted. Careful not to overcook as they would lose their natural pretty green colour.Dish up the cooked spinach and set aside in a warm place.Now make the sauce.Peel off the hard outer layer of 2 stalks of lemon grass. Slice into 2 inch long pieces and using the back of your knife, bash the lemongrass and bruise the slightly for the fragrance and flavours to emit.. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan.When the butter has melted and is bubbling slightly, add the lemongrass. Cook at medium heat for 30 seconds.. Add 150ml of fresh liquid cream.. Let the mixture come to a gentle rolling boil.. Add 1 teaspoon of liquid chicken stock concentrate. Or you can use 1/2 cube of chicken stock bouillon. Stir it in well, and do a taste check. If its not salty enough, add more chicken stock.. Whisk the sauce as it boils and thickens.After a couple of minutes, the sauce would have thickened.. Remove the lemongrass.. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I usually use a strainer and squeeze a lemon directly over the sauce. Do a taste check.. Add more lemon juice if necessary.. Whisk well to combine.The salmon should be done by now.. Remove them from the oven.Plate your dish but placing some spinach and carrots at the bottom of a plate or shallow dish.Gently place the salmon fillet on top..

This liquid will become part of the sauce.Â . Drain the noodles and rinse in cold water, so theyâ€™ll stop cooking. Cooked ramen should be springy but not spongy.Â . Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over high heat in a sautÃ© pan and brown the ground pork. Use a wooden spoon to break apart any clumps. DoÂ notÂ season the meat with salt and pepper.Â . Cook the pork until itâ€™s browned or even let it cook until itâ€™s crisp, your preference.Â . After about 8 minutes, the pork should have nicely browned and can be removed from the pan.Â . Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil to the same pan and sautÃ© the celery and/or any other vegetable youâ€™re using for about two minutes.. Add garlic for another 30 seconds.Â . Add reserved pasta water to the pan and stir in three tablespoons of oyster and soy sauce each.Â . Use a wooden spoon to scrape off the burnt pork bits (the best stuff) from the bottom of the pan.Â . Add the pork back into the pan and then add the noodles.. Finally, add some heat like hot sauce, chili paste, sriracha, hot pepper flakes, etc, and mix everything well.Â . Sprinkle with some chopped cilantro, garnish with lime wedges, and serve. I love to squeeze some lime juice over everything. It gives the dish a light, refreshing touch that mingles nicely with the spiciness and the umami flavor provided by the oyster and soy sauces.Â ",86.6776,4,119.73,""{\"percentProtein\": 17.84, \"percentFat\": 50.47, \"percentCarbs\": 31.69}"","Boosting Focus and Productivity",""{\"vegetarian\": false, \"vegan\": false, \"glutenFree\": true, \"dairyFree\": true}"",NULL,NULL,NULL

I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic.. Along with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl.. Then I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside.. See?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm. And get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface.. Im going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down!. Then cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown.. I even brown each tip, like so.. Finally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time.. The house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check.. Oh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a. Oven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in.. I make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing. Then chopping my cucumber.. I throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper. And I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do.. When my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend.. I spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see.. We purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept.. I had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.  Every few minutes or so, I toss it afresh; this reactive base quick-pickles my onion slices transforming the flavor from pungent to perky sweet.. For the last 10 minutes of cooking my roast, I remove the foil from the top to expose the skin to the heat.  I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp.. Meanwhile, my onions have pickled. And Ive layered my baby spinach over them. Before I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan.. I toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch.. My pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender.. This hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold.. Topped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.  This is an elegant, delicious dinner that welcomes the first breezes of early spring  through freshly re-opened windows.  Light, fresh, and fantastic: I wish I could have you all over for dinner, because this was a company meal!",89.0917,10,339.11,""{\"percentProtein\": 37.78, \"percentFat\": 40.94, \"percentCarbs\": 21.28}"","Reducing Anxiety",""{\"vegetarian\": false, \"vegan\": false, \"glutenFree\": true, \"dairyFree\": false}"",NULL,NULL,NULL

My folks originated from this area of the sub-continet and hence this was popular at home.. Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender with 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend to a paste.. Put the chops, tomatoes, onions, cayenne pepper, yoghurt, salt and ginger-garlic paste into a large wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir and bring to the boil. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer for 50 minutes or until the chops are almost cooked.. Add the cumin seeds and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the meat is tender and the sauce thick.. Add the garam masala and lemon juice and stir.. Sprinkle fresh coriander over the top and serve.TIPSIn the Punjab, tomatoes are grated to make a puree - don't be tempted to use ready-prepared tomato puree instead of fresh.The spice combinations in garam masala vary in different parts of India. In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick, 4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg..

In a separate bowl add both mascarpone cheese, vanilla and amaretto. Using a hand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the cheese until fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. DO NOT over mix.. Fold the whip cream into the cheese using a spatula. Its important to not stir or over mix the cream with the cheese, because you want the mixture to be fluffy and light.. Dip the lady fingers into the coffee, soaking it for about 30 seconds - 1 minutes. You want them to be soft, but not mushy and breaking.. In a square or rectangle dish (I used square) add a layer of lady fingers. Scoop about 1/2 of the mixture on top and spread evenly. I sprinkle the layer with a little confectioners sugar. Then add another layer of lady fingers and add the remaining cheese mixture.. Spread evenly making sure to coat all the cookies. You do not want to see any of the cookie part. After, place the cocoa powder into a small sifter and soft over the tiramisu, coating it evenly. Cover with a lid/plastic/foil wrap and place in the fridge for about 2 hours or more..

Add the wet ingredients one at a time as listed, until full incorporated.  This ensures the batter comes out nice and smooth. Take a springfoam pan like the one pictured below or a standard 9-inch round pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.. Pour the batter about 3/4 of the way, leaving room for the cake to rise when baking.. Place in the oven for 35 minutes, you can check the doneness by inserting a toothpick in the middle, if it comes out clean it is ready.  Allow to cool and place in the freezer.  (This makes the cake easier to cut)For the chocolate mousse, place the chocolate chips and butter in a double boiler as pictured below.  Simply heat water in a large pot at medium heat and place a mixing bowl over it.  This helps you melt the chocolate and butter without burning it.  Be cautious of letting the water boil, it could potentially get inside the bowl with the chocolate and butter and that is a BIG no-no. Once melted and mixed thoroughly, set aside and cool to room temperature.Meanwhile, whip the egg whites until they are firm and hold peaks and add the sugar.  Be careful not to over whip the egg whites, they should be shiny and smooth, not chunky.  Also make sure the bowl you are whipping your egg whites in is dry and contains no water or any liquid  this ensures that your whites will form peaks or else youll be whipping until your arm falls off with no results.. Mix the melted chocolate with your egg whites in a folding motion  you do not want to over mix or you will flatten your egg whites and that will make your mousse goopy. Whip the cream and when partially stiff add the vanilla.  Once it is thick fold it into chocolate egg white mixture.  Set aside.For the Chocolate Ganace, heat the cream and butter in medium sauce pan at medium heat.. Add the brandy once the cream begins to bubble and pour over chocolate chips.. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated.Take the cake out from the freezer.  If you are using a spring foam pan fill it with the chocolate mousse to the top and place it back into the freezer.If you are using the standard 9 inch pan flip it upside down onto a flat surface with parchment paper.  If you have a torch, torch the sides and bottom of the pan, this will release the cake from the pan.  If you do not own a torch, take a paring knife along the edges of the pan and firmly tap the pan upside down, the cake should pop out.    Then cut the cake in half horizontally  the easiest way to do this is to trace where you want to cut first around the edges of the cake and then cut into it the rest of the way.  I use to just cut it without tracing and ended up with uneven, unhappy cake pieces.Another reason why you place the cakes in the freezer is so that the ganache frosting comes out nice and shiny.  If the cake is warm, the icing comes out dull.. Place one of the cake halves onto a wire rack and spread the top with chocolate mousse and place the other half on top. It is important that the cake is on a wire rack so the ganache can drip through.   Carefully pour the ganache ontop of the cake, starting from the center and allowing it to drip down the sides.",33.3415,12,62.37,""{\"percentProtein\": 7.27, \"percentFat\": 59.41, \"percentCarbs\": 33.32}"","Improving Mood and Well-being",""{\"vegetarian\": false, \"vegan\": false, \"glutenFree\": false, \"dairyFree\": false}"",NULL,NULL,NULL

Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large 'gumbo pot' boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.. Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called 'dead man,' or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).. Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic. Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.. Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove.. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor.. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.. Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine.. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.. Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot.. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now.. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.. Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now.. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.. Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease.. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh.. Add to gumbo pot.. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended.. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.. Skim any excess fat.. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.. To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce.
